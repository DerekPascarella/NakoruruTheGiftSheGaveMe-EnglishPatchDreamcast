.------------::[ v1.0 Release Notes ]::-------------
|
| japanese title: Nakoruru: Ano Hito kara no Okurimono (ナコルル〜あのひとからのおくりもの〜)
|
| things to note:
| -game supports vibration
| -set text speed to "instant"
| -everything is translated (images, text, menus), only thing in English was "Press
|  Start Button" on title screen
| -lyrics input minigame, went from basic Kana lesson to just teaching Japanese
|  phoenetics to the player
| -new font sheet
| -save files metadata and vmu icons all show in english in dc save manager in bios
| -custom english logo by Nico.
| -translated VMU icon by Danthrax4 (i did the "LOADING" one).
| -i did all other graphics myself.
| -quiz time-limit removed in order to allow player to research questions, as they were
|  all very Japanese/Ainu culture specific, and changing them to something Western
|  didn't blend well with the rest of the game.
| -marshal lead translation with assistance from piggy and duralumin (let all three
|  write a paragraph about the project, their backgrounds, etc.).
| -lewis was lead editor, which is one of the most important roles for delivering
|  a script that's fun for players to read.
| -ainu language/culture, special thanks to Lacquerware for helping locate old forum
|  discussing meaning of some terms.
| -unlockable content:
|	* character bios / messages from voice actors
|	* picture gallery
|   * music gallery/sound test
|   * vmu icons to download
| -bonus disc with unlocked vmu save, theme song, and OVA episode.
|   * uses dreampassport web browser, couldn't figure out how to disable screensaver,
|     so when screensaver shows up, just press a button on the d-pad to make it go
|     away.  also hope you like the screensaver!
| -disc content in repo, little clock programs, also translated (virus-free!)
|
| custom tooling:
| -various webapps to aid the team in day-to-day tasks (script searchers, dialog box
|  previews, etc.).
| -utilities to extract script and generate spreadsheets hosted in Google Drive to
|  give team easy way to collaborate, adding DeepL translation for reference.
| -utility to insert new english script back into game, modifying various pointers and
|  offsets in order to extend to multiple textboxes to fit all of our english text.
